Flipkart is one of the leading e-commerce companies/platforms based in India.The sentiment analysis of the product reviews is a way that can open ways to understand the performance of the products, which is beneficial for both future customers and the e-commerce platform. 
The dataset I am using here for Flipkart reviews sentiment analysis is downloaded from Kaggle.

Conclusion
From this project, we get the output as there are 923.55 Positive reviews, 96.77 Negative reviews, and 1283.68 Neutral reviews. 
So, most people give Neutral reviews, and a small proportion of people give Negative reviews. So we can say that people are satisfied with Flipkart products and services.
